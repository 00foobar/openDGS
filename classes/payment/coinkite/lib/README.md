## Introduction

Every request made to the Coinkite API requires three special header
lines. This code can generate the timestamp and signature value
required for 2 of those 3 headers. The remaining header is just
the API key itself.

Header lines you need:

	X-CK-Key: K5555a555-55a555aa-a55aa5a5555aaa5a
	X-CK-Timestamp: 2014-06-23T03:10:04.905376
	X-CK-Sign: 0aa7755aaa45189a98a5a8a887a564aa55aa5aa4aa7a98aa2858aaa60a5a56aa

## How to Install

Replace the two values shown here.

````php
	$API_KEY = 'this-is-my-key';
	$API_SECRET = 'this-is-my-secret';
````

The keys you need can be created on
[Coinkite.com under Merchant / API]([https://coinkite.com/merchant/api).
